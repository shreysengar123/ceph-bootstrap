ceph-bootstrap
==============

some shell scripts for a local single-node ceph install 

- `ceph-install.sh` -> install a single node ceph, 3 osds (as folders)
- `rgw-install.sh` -> install radosgw with fcgi, runs on port 8080
- `objstore.sh` -> configures swift endpoint for rgw, needs openrc creds
